The problem itself was simple, and since I decided to use a bit more structure than strictly necessary, part 2 was trivial to achieve.

I spent most of the time setting up Go, gopls, remembering to initialize maps etc.

It was fun to (partly) implement a Trie for this. Again, not necessary per se, but why not?
