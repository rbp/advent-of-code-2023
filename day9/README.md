Part 1 is again straightforward. I did the step calculations in place, so I use O(n) memory - n being the size of the input. And realising that the second step of "moving up" is simply the sum of the last elements of each line makes for a quick and simple solution.

Part 2 was very simple (though I did have a bug that required some print debugging), just a natural extension of part 1.
