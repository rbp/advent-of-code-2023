I like a good maze. Which this isn't... But it was interesting nonetheless. In part 1, I got a bit confused with the pointer de-referencing syntax and Go's equality comparison of structs, but as soon as that was sorted out, it was all fine.

It took me a while to get the algorithm for part 2 right. I tried a couple of things only to realise they would not work in all cases. I actually think the current one would not work on *all* cases (I might need to reset the final sweep), but it's close enough.

It was also good practice in using *dlv* for debugging.
